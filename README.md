# Synchronization among temporal scales: the MECS algorithm

Event Synchronization analysis was originally conceived for providing a simple and robust method to measure synchronization between two time series. This algorithm, however, and those developed as extensions thereof do not directly deal with multiple temporal scales. We extended the state-of-the-art of Event Synchronization techniques by conceiving Multi-Event-Class Synchronization (MECS). MECS measures synchronization between events - belonging to different event classes - that are detected in multiple time series. MECS can compute synchronization between events belonging to the same class (intra-class synchronization) or to different classes (inter-class synchronization). Our technique can deal with macro-events, i.e., aggregations of events that enable analysis at multiple temporal scales.
